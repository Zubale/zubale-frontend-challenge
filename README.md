# Zubale Mobile Challenge 

At Zubale we are all about raising people up and inspiring people. We need a great way to track inspirational quotes. So we need you to write an App that will let people suggest quotes and vote on the ones they like. 

If you do a great job we have existing prizes. And the best of the best will get a chance to come work with us. 

The requirements are:
1. Clone this repo and create your own branch
2. Build an Android App 
3. Allow them to submit quotes
4. Allow them to vote on quotes
5. Allow them to see what quotes are getting the most votes
6. Push your code early and often 
7. Provide an APK for your app
8. Provide a readme explaining your work
9. Include how to contact you in the readme
10. When you are done, open a PR

Your solution does not need to talk to a backend. It can be completely contained on the phone. You are also free to use any technology or libraries you like, but extra points will be given for React Native.
