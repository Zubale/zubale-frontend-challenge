# Zubale Mobile Challenge 

At Zubale we are all about raising people up and inspiring people. We need a great way to track inspirational quotes. So, we need you to write an App that will let people suggest quotes and vote on the ones they like the best. 

We hope doing this is fun, but we are also are always looking for the best people to join our team. We will be happy to review your submission and consider you for a possition at Zubale. 

The requirements are:
1. Fork this repo and clone it to start working
2. Build an Android App 
3. Allow the user to submit quotes
4. Allow the user to vote on quotes
5. Allow the user to see what quotes are getting the most votes
6. Push your code early and often 
7. Provide an APK for your app
8. Provide a readme explaining your work
9. Include how to contact you in the readme (WhatsApp & Email)
10. When you are done, open a PR from your fork to this repo

Your solution does not need to talk to a backend. It can be completely contained on the phone. You are also free to use any technology or libraries you like, but extra points will be given for React Native.
