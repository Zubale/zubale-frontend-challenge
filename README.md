# Zubale Mobile Challenge 

At Zubale we are all about raising people up and inspiring people. We need a great way to track inspirational quotes. So we need you to write an App that will let people suggest quotes and vote on the ones they like the best. 

We hope doing this is fun, but we are also offering prizes for the best entries. The very best will be given a chance to come work with us, as we harness people's smart phones to change the world. 

This challenge is self-paced, however, we do have a meetup scheduled in the near future where we will be reviewing solutions and offering prizes. Please RSVP to attend here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RwK22DIWBfLrz3UCF5bv-HXtxv-zGs9a9kjmL3vjoxw/edit?usp=sharing
