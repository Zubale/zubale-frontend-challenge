# Zubale Mobile Challenge 

At Zubale we are all about raising people up and inspiring people. We need a great way to track inspirational quotes. So, we need you to write an App that will let people suggest quotes and vote on the ones they like the best. 

We hope doing this is fun, but we are also offering prizes for the best entries. The very best will be given a chance to come work with us, as we harness people's smart phones to change the world.

The prizes are:

*	Third Place: $5,000 pesos
*	Second Place: $10,000 pesos
*	Grand Prize: $30,000 pesos

To be considered for the prizes you will need to submit your work before May 13th.
 
This challenge is self-paced; however, we do have a meetup scheduled in the near future where we will discuss the challenge and introduce Zubale (pizza and drinks will be provided). Please RSVP to attend here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RwK22DIWBfLrz3UCF5bv-HXtxv-zGs9a9kjmL3vjoxw/edit?usp=sharing
